# Custom Event Parser

This client template for Google Tag Manager Server-Side takes an incoming GET request, extracts information from the query string, headers, IP, and cookies and returns the data to the server container as an event object. It is vendor agnostic and can handle any GET tracking request.

For an example request like `https://myServerContainer.com/measure?property1=value1&property2=value2&property3=value3`, the **event data mapping** for the object returned would look like this:

Event Object Key | Source
--- | ---
property1 | Query String 
property2 | Query String
property3 | Query String
page_location | Request Header: referer
user_agent | Request Header: user-agent
ip_override | GTM Server-Side Tagging API
timestamp | GTM Server-Side Tagging API
*CookieName* | Request Header: cookie (*CookieName* as specified in the template input field)
